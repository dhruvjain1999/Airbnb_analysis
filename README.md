# Airbnb Superhost Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to classify Airbnb hosts as superhosts or not based on various characteristics available in the dataset. The goal is to help Airbnb make informed decisions about awarding the superhost badge to hosts, enhancing customer satisfaction and trust.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 26,451 rows and 45 columns, including details about host response time, response rate, acceptance rate, and other host and listing characteristics.

## Flowchart
Below is the flowchart that outlines the steps involved in the project:

## Data Pre-processing and EDA
1. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Removed the `host_neighbourhood` column due to a high percentage of missing values.
   - Filled NA values in `host_response_time` and `host_acceptance_rate` as they are crucial for predicting superhost status.
   
2. **Type Conversion**:
   - Converted key variables to their correct data types.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed irrelevant columns such as `host_id`, `host_name`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Ensured data was clean and ready for model fitting with 22 essential variables for training and testing.

## Modeling
1. **Classification Models**:
   - Used logistic regression to identify significant predictor variables and created a reduced model.
   - Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find the best `k` for classification.
   - Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial kernel for classification.

2. **Regression Models**:
   - Explored Lasso, Ridge, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Random Forest Regressor.
   - Conducted cross-validation to determine the best hyperparameters for each model.
   - Evaluated model performance using the mean squared error (MSE) on the test set.

## Results
- **Classification**:
  - SVM with radial kernel achieved the highest accuracy of 81% on the test set.
  
- **Regression**:
  - Random Forest Regressor had the best performance with the lowest MSE on the test set.

## Conclusion
Random Forest Regressor was selected as the final model due to its superior performance in minimizing MSE on the test set. This model will help Airbnb make data-driven decisions in awarding the superhost badge, improving host accountability and customer trust.

## Future Work
- Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters.
- Incorporate additional data sources for improved prediction accuracy.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques for better performance.
